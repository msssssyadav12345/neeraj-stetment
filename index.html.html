         <p>I am, Neeraj Yadav, recently completed my B.F.A. from the Department of Fine Arts, Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, Varanasi. B.F. A. Received education from.</p>
    
    
          <p>One year after passing Intermediate, I got B. F. A. Came to know about and after that I started drawing. I continued my art studies with focus since my early art days.  The number of landscape paintings in my study list of painting is more than 600 and I worked in all mediums like person portrait, composition, sketching, memory painting.</p>   
           <p>My art styles also include some other arts like wood carving, flute playing etc.</p>
         <p>In the middle of studying Chitrakala, I joined yoga and gained some knowledge about life. After knowing this, my life started becoming easier and then I started trying to show  the truth of life in my paintings.</p> 
      <p>In my life, I have never had any complaints against any person or art material regarding my studies. The four years of study went on smoothly. In the coming time,  I will give a new twist to art with my art which will be something different in the art world. My topic will be related to truth and health.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">To make our art ideas successful we need a good art guru</h2>
